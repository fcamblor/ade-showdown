      'Whether the orchestrator itself confines agent tool-calls inside a sandbox (container, micro-VM, chroot, macOS sandbox-exec…), independently of git-worktree filesystem separation. Tools that simply delegate sandboxing to the underlying agent CLI count as "no" at the orchestrator layer. The note records the underlying technology when supported.',

      'A "yes" requires the orchestrator to drive models from several distinct vendors (Anthropic + OpenAI + Google + …). Supporting only multiple Anthropic models (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku) — or only multiple OpenAI models — counts as "no" because it locks the user into a single vendor. Two vendors is treated as "partial" since the surface remains thin compared to broadly multi-vendor orchestrators.',
